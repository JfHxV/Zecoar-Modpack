**Switch Resourcepacks**

Don't like Rainbowpixel? Don't worry. We have in-built another three resoucepacks —— CozyUI+, OreUI and Unique Dark Refined.

If you want to switch resourcepacks, you must disable `彩虹像素RainbowPixel~☆...`, `彩虹像素☆村民交易UI删减包`, `南烛☆彩虹像素GUI`, `南烛☆**血量x**饱食度`, than you can enable the resourcepack which you want to use.

**Notes**

1. If you add a mod yourself, it may cause the game to crash, so before adding it, make sure it does not conflict with the mods in the modpack.
2. The shaderpack "[Complementary Reimgained](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined)" is belong to EminGT.Any problem about this shaderpack is entirely under the responsibility of the author of Zecoar Modpack.
3. The shaderpack "Complementary Reimgained" require high graphics card, low configuration users please use the shaderpacks which import by users.
4. If you are a MC server owner,welcome to use my modpack as a server client, you can also ask me to customize the client(base on Zecoar Modpack).
